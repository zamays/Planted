   # Run linting
   pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

## Linting

We use Pylint to maintain code quality. Before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

Configuration is in `.pylintrc` and `pyproject.toml`.

## Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Update documentation** in README.md if needed
2. **Add examples** of how to use the feature
3. **Consider cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
4. **Test on multiple Python versions** (3.9+)

## Adding Plants to the Database

To add new plants:

1. Edit `garden_manager/database/default_plants_data.py`
2. Add your plant data to the `plants_data` list
3. Follow the existing plant data structure
4. Include all required fields:
   - name, plant_type, scientific_name
   - planting_seasons, hardiness_zones
   - days_to_germination, days_to_maturity
   - spacing_inches, soil_requirements
   - light_requirements, water_requirements
   - care_notes

## Creating Issues

We value high-quality, well-structured issues that help the team work efficiently. Whether you're reporting a bug, requesting a feature, or suggesting an improvement, please follow these guidelines:

### Using GitHub Copilot for Issues

We've created comprehensive guidelines for using GitHub Copilot to draft and manage issues. See **[Copilot Issue Instructions](COPILOT-ISSUE-INSTRUCTIONS.md)** for detailed guidance on:

- Creating high-quality issue descriptions
- Managing parent/child relationships between issues
- Using templates and metadata effectively
- Ensuring actionable and detailed content

### Quick Issue Guidelines

**All issues should include:**

1. **Clear, action-oriented title** - Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Improve)
2. **Overview** - Brief summary of what needs to be done and why
3. **Requirements** - Specific, numbered list of what needs to be implemented
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable conditions for completion

### Reporting Bugs
