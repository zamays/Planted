# Plant Data Sources

## Overview

The plant information in Planted is compiled from reliable, authoritative sources to ensure accuracy and usefulness for gardeners. All plant data including growing requirements, companion planting information, and care instructions has been verified against multiple reputable sources.

## Primary Data Sources

### 1. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
- **Source**: USDA Plants Database (plants.usda.gov)
- **Information Used**: Scientific names, botanical classifications, native ranges, and hardiness zone data
- **Reliability**: Official government database maintained by agricultural scientists

### 2. University Extension Programs
- **Sources**:
  - Cornell University Cooperative Extension
  - University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources
  - Iowa State University Extension and Outreach
  - Oregon State University Extension Service
- **Information Used**: Growing calendars, planting methods, spacing requirements, days to maturity, companion planting, and cultural care practices
- **Reliability**: Peer-reviewed information from agricultural research institutions

### 3. The Old Farmer's Almanac
- **Source**: Almanac.com
- **Information Used**: Planting calendars, companion planting charts, and traditional gardening wisdom
- **Reliability**: Published since 1792, combines historical knowledge with modern agricultural science

### 4. Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)
- **Source**: RHS.org.uk
- **Information Used**: Plant care requirements, optimal growing conditions, and botanical information
- **Reliability**: UK's leading gardening charity with over 200 years of horticultural expertise

## Data Validation Process

Each plant entry in our database has been cross-referenced against at least two authoritative sources to ensure:

1. **Botanical Accuracy**: Scientific names verified against USDA Plants Database and RHS
2. **Growing Requirements**: Days to germination, maturity, and spacing confirmed through university extension publications
3. **Care Instructions**: Sun, water, and soil requirements validated across multiple sources
4. **Companion Planting**: Relationships confirmed through agricultural research and documented traditional practices
5. **Climate Zones**: USDA Hardiness Zones verified against official USDA maps and regional extension recommendations

## Plant Categories

### Vegetables (21 plants)
All vegetable data is primarily sourced from university extension programs and USDA resources, with growing parameters validated for general US climate zones.

### Herbs (10 plants)
Herb information combines culinary and medicinal herb databases with extension service growing guides, ensuring both botanical accuracy and practical growing information.

### Fruits (7 plants)
Fruit tree and berry information is sourced from university extension fruit production guides and USDA pomology databases, focusing on common backyard varieties suitable for home gardens.

## Companion Planting Data

Companion planting recommendations are based on:
- Scientific studies on allelopathy (plant-to-plant chemical interactions)
- Agricultural research on pest management through polyculture
- Historical gardening practices documented in agricultural literature
- Modern permaculture principles validated through field research

## Climate Zone Information

Climate zone data uses the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map (2023 update) as the primary reference. Zones indicate where plants will reliably grow based on average annual minimum winter temperatures.

## Continuous Improvement

We regularly review and update plant information as:
- New cultivars become available
- Agricultural research provides updated recommendations
- Regional extension services publish revised growing guides
- User feedback identifies areas for clarification or correction

## Contributing Plant Data

When adding new plants to the database, contributors should:
1. Verify scientific names using the USDA Plants Database
2. Cross-reference growing requirements with at least two university extension sources
3. Document data sources in pull request descriptions
4. Ensure all required fields have accurate, non-null values
5. Include appropriate companion planting relationships with supporting references
